# Pymaceuticals
I've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

The following was generated:
  - A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

  - A bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of data points for each treatment regimen.

  - A pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

  - Calculation of the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), the quartiles, IQR and potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

  - A box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot.

  - A line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

  - A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.

  - Calculation of the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plotted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
